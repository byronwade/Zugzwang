# Production Deployment Command (ULTRATHINK)

**Comprehensive production deployment pipeline with Vercel MCP, GitHub CLI, security audits, performance monitoring, and production best practices.**

## Your Mission

Execute a bulletproof production deployment workflow that ensures maximum reliability, security, and performance. This command implements enterprise-grade deployment practices with automated validation at every step.

## Pre-Deployment Validation Phase

### 1. Environment & Security Audit
```bash
# Check Node.js and tooling versions
node --version && npm --version && gh --version

# Security audit - FAIL FAST on vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level moderate
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DETECTED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  npm audit --audit-level moderate --json > security-audit.json
  exit 1
fi

# Check for exposed secrets in .env files
grep -r "sk_" . --exclude-dir=node_modules || echo "✅ No API keys detected in code"
grep -r "pk_" . --exclude-dir=node_modules || echo "✅ No public keys detected in code"
```

### 2. Code Quality & Type Safety Validation
```bash
# Type checking with strict mode
npm run lint
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ LINTING FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit --strict
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ TYPESCRIPT ERRORS - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# Bundle size analysis
npx @next/bundle-analyzer
```

### 3. Database Migration Safety
```bash
# Generate and validate database schema
npm run db:generate
npm run db:check

# Create backup point (if production database)
echo "📊 Database schema validated"

# Run migrations in dry-run mode first
npm run db:migrate
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ DATABASE MIGRATION FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Build & Performance Validation Phase

### 4. Production Build with Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next
npm run build --turbopack

# Verify build succeeded
if [ ! -d ".next" ]; then
  echo "❌ BUILD FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# Check bundle sizes
echo "📦 Bundle Analysis:"
du -sh .next/static/chunks/*.js | head -10
```

### 5. Comprehensive Testing Suite
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ TESTS FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# Mobile-specific testing
npm run test:mobile
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ MOBILE TESTS FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ PERFORMANCE TESTS FAILED - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED"
  exit 1
fi

# 🚀 PRE-DEPLOYMENT MCP PERFORMANCE BASELINE
echo "📊 Capturing performance baseline with Chrome DevTools MCP..."
# Pre-deployment performance validation
# mcp__chrome-devtools__new_page(http://localhost:3000) → Test local build
# mcp__chrome-devtools__performance_start_trace(reload: true, autoStop: true) → Baseline
# mcp__chrome-devtools__performance_stop_trace() → Capture pre-deploy metrics
# mcp__chrome-devtools__list_network_requests() → Bundle analysis
echo "🎯 Pre-deployment performance baseline captured"
```

## Vercel Environment & Configuration Phase

### 6. Vercel Environment Validation
```bash
# Check if Vercel CLI is authenticated
vercel whoami
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ VERCEL NOT AUTHENTICATED - RUN: vercel login"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate required environment variables for production
REQUIRED_VARS=(
  "DATABASE_URL"
  "NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
  "NEXTAUTH_URL"
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL"
)

echo "🔐 Validating Vercel environment variables..."
for var in "${REQUIRED_VARS[@]}"; do
  vercel env ls | grep "$var" || {
    echo "❌ MISSING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE: $var"
    echo "💡 Add with: vercel env add $var"
    exit 1
  }
done

# Check production environment variables exist
vercel env ls --environment production | wc -l
if [ $(vercel env ls --environment production | wc -l) -lt 5 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Limited production environment variables detected"
fi
```

### 7. Pre-Deployment Security Checks
```bash
# Scan for common security issues
echo "🔒 Running security scans..."

# Check for hardcoded secrets
git secrets --scan || echo "✅ No secrets detected in git history"

# Validate HTTPS redirects
grep -r "http://" app/ && echo "⚠️  HTTP links detected - should be HTTPS" || echo "✅ All links use HTTPS"

# Check for console.log statements (production cleanup)
grep -r "console.log" app/ && echo "⚠️  Console statements detected" || echo "✅ No debug statements"
```

## Git & Version Control Phase

### 8. Git Repository Validation
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  echo "📝 Uncommitted changes detected. Committing..."

  # Add all changes
  git add .

  # Create comprehensive commit message
  git commit -m "🚀 Production deployment $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

```

## Usage Instructions

Run this command when you're ready to deploy to production. It will:

1. **Security First**: Audit dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
2. **Quality Assurance**: Run comprehensive tests and type checking
3. **Performance**: Validate bundle sizes and run performance tests with **MCP baseline capture**
4. **Environment**: Ensure all production variables are configured
5. **Build**: Create optimized production build
6. **Deploy**: Push to Vercel with full validation
7. **ULTRATHINK MCP Validation**: **Chrome DevTools MCP + Playwright MCP performance testing**
8. **Verify**: Health checks and performance audits with **MCP-validated Core Web Vitals**
9. **Documentation**: Create GitHub release with **MCP performance metrics**
10. **Monitoring**: Set up tracking and provide monitoring links

The deployment will **FAIL FAST** at any validation step to prevent broken deployments reaching production.

## Emergency Rollback

If issues are detected post-deployment:

```bash
# Quick rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# Or rollback to specific deployment
vercel ls
vercel rollback [deployment-url]
```

This command implements enterprise-grade deployment practices ensuring your production environment remains stable, secure, and performant.
