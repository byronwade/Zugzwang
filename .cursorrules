## Coding Environment

The user is expected to work with and inquire about the following coding languages and tools:

- **ReactJS** for creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.

- **NextJS** for building server-rendered and statically generated pages with optimized performance.

- **JavaScript** as the foundational language for modern web applications.

- **TypeScript** for adding type safety and enhancing code maintainability.

- **TailwindCSS** for rapid, utility-first styling solutions.

- **HTML** and **CSS** as the base layers of web design and layout.

The user should also demonstrate familiarity with key APIs, such as the Shopify Storefront API and Admin API, for managing e-commerce platforms efficiently.

## Comprehensive Analysis Process

### 1. Request Analysis

Every task begins with a careful analysis to ensure a robust understanding:

- **Identify Task Type:** Clearly determine if the task involves code creation, debugging, architecture planning, or optimization.

- **Understand the Context:** Define explicit and implicit requirements, identifying key outcomes.

- **Assess Project Constraints:** Evaluate deadlines, platform compatibility, and any resource limitations.

- **Framework and Language Mapping:** Pinpoint all relevant tools and technologies in use.

### 2. Solution Planning

Develop a structured roadmap for tackling the request:

- Break down the solution into **manageable steps** with clearly defined objectives.

- Prioritize **modularity and reusability** to ensure scalability.

- Map out **dependencies and required files** to minimize integration issues.

- Analyze potential **alternative approaches** to select the most efficient path.

- Plan for rigorous **testing and validation** at each stage.

### 3. Implementation Strategy

Adopt strategies that guarantee optimized performance:

- Choose **design patterns** that best fit the project's scope and requirements.

- Optimize for **speed, responsiveness, and scalability**.

- Incorporate robust **error handling** and address edge cases.

- Ensure compliance with **accessibility standards** for inclusive design.

- Align the implementation with **best practices** in web development.

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write **concise, readable TypeScript** code that adheres to clear logic and flow.

- Embrace **functional programming patterns** to reduce complexity.

- Follow the **DRY principle** to eliminate redundancy.

- Implement **early returns** for clearer and more efficient functions.

- Ensure logical separation in component architecture, including **exports**, **helpers**, **types**, and **subcomponents**.

### Naming Conventions

- Use **descriptive and intuitive names** with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).

- Prefix event handlers with `handle` for clarity (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`).

- Maintain consistent directory naming conventions (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

- Prefer **named exports** for better reusability and readability.

### TypeScript Best Practices

- Leverage **TypeScript** for all implementations.

- Use **interfaces** over **types** for structured data definitions.

- Replace enums with **const maps** to reduce runtime overhead.

- Prioritize **type inference** and avoid unnecessary type assertions.

- Utilize the `satisfies` operator for stricter type validation.

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Guidelines

### Component Architecture

- Prioritize the use of **React Server Components (RSC)** to improve server-side rendering efficiency.

- Only create **Client Components** when absolutely necessary.

- Avoid `'use client'` directives unless strictly needed for interactivity.

- Ensure any Client Components are lightweight and perform essential tasks only.

- Integrate **error boundaries** to gracefully handle failures.

- Use **Suspense** for managing asynchronous operations and enhancing UX.

- Optimize rendering by monitoring and improving **Web Vitals** performance metrics.

### Caching Strategy

- Use `"use cache"` exclusively for caching in Next.js 15. Unstable caching methods like `unstable_cache` are no longer supported. (https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache)

- Avoid using `tags`, `validates`, or dynamic imports for caching and validation. The new features in Next.js 15 make these unnecessary.

- Ensure cache strategies align with server-side rendering requirements and minimize redundant calls.

### State Management

- Transition to `useActionState` to manage state effectively.

- Leverage `useFormStatus` for enhanced form handling capabilities.

- Implement **URL-driven state management** with utilities like `nuqs`.

- Minimize client-side state to reduce memory usage and improve scalability.

### Advanced Async APIs

- Ensure all parameters, search parameters, and handlers are awaited individually.

- Avoid using dot notation when awaiting values. Each `await` should be on a separate line for clarity and error tracking.

```typescript

const cookiesData = await cookies();

const headersData = await headers();

const { isEnabled } = await draftMode();

const params = await props.params;

const searchParams = await props.searchParams;

```

### Data Fetching Principles

- Default to **server-side fetching** for dynamic content.

- Explicitly cache data with `cache: 'force-cache'` or configure layouts with `fetchCache` to optimize static data reuse.

- Integrate **SWR** or **React Query** for managing client-side queries efficiently.

- Monitor fetching patterns to avoid excessive revalidation.

### Route Handlers

```typescript

export async function GET(request: Request) {

  const params = await request.params;

  // Additional error handling

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(params));

}

```

## Shopify API Integration

### Shopify Storefront API Usage

- Leverage the **Storefront API** to deliver fast, interactive e-commerce solutions.

- Use GraphQL to request only necessary fields, reducing payload size and improving performance.

### Shopify Admin API Implementation

- Develop **RESTful interactions** with the Admin API for efficient backend management.

- Streamline common tasks like product creation and order management using pre-configured API clients.

```typescript

const admin = new Shopify.Clients.Rest('myshop.myshopify.com', process.env.SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN);

export async function createOrder(orderData) {

  return admin.post({

    path: 'orders',

    data: orderData,

    type: Shopify.Clients.Rest.DataType.JSON

  });

}

```

## UI and Performance Enhancements

### Tailwind CSS Styling

- Prioritize a **mobile-first approach** with responsive utilities.

- Implement **consistent spacing** and **component-specific styles** for maintainability.

- Use **CSS variables** to centralize themes and improve adaptability.

### Accessibility Standards

- Implement ARIA attributes to improve navigation for assistive technologies.

- Follow **keyboard navigability best practices** for interactive elements.

- Ensure compliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** for broader inclusivity.

- Test accessibility features using tools like **axe DevTools** and screen readers.

### Optimization Strategies

- Use **lazy loading** for non-critical assets to improve initial page load speeds.

- Implement **code-splitting** to deliver only the necessary JavaScript bundles.

- Integrate monitoring tools to continuously track **Core Web Vitals** and identify areas for improvement.

- Minimize render-blocking resources with efficient asset preloading.

## Configuration and Validation

### Next.js Configuration

```javascript

const nextConfig = {

  experimental: {

    cacheModes: { static: 180, dynamic: 30 },

  },

};

```

### TypeScript Compiler Options

```json

{

  "compilerOptions": {

    "target": "ES2022",

    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],

    "module": "esnext",

    "paths": { "@/*": ["src/*"] }

  }

}

```
