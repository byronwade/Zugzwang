# üß† AI Predictions Status

## Current State: **Statistical Mode** (No AI API Configured)

The enterprise AI system is fully built and ready, but currently operating in **statistical fallback mode** because no AI API keys are configured.

## What's Happening Now

When you see this in the console:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è [AI Engine] No AI capabilities configured - using statistical mode
```

This means predictions are being calculated using:
- ‚úÖ Advanced statistical algorithms
- ‚úÖ User behavior patterns
- ‚úÖ Historical interaction data
- ‚úÖ Time decay factors
- ‚úÖ Weighted scoring system
- ‚ùå **NOT using actual AI API calls**

## How to Enable Real AI Predictions

### Option 1: Use Groq (Recommended - Has Free Tier!)
1. Get a free API key from https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=groq
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_API_KEY=gsk_your-groq-key-here
AI_API_KEY=gsk_your-groq-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS=true
```

### Option 2: Use OpenAI
1. Get an API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=openai
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS=true
```

### Option 3: Use Anthropic (Claude)
1. Get an API key from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
2. Add to your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS=true
```

## What Happens When AI is Enabled

With API keys configured, you'll see:
```
üß† [AI Engine] Enterprise AI prediction for gid://shopify/Product/123
üéØ [AI Engine] AI prediction complete: 85% confidence
```

The system will then use:
- **Collaborative Filtering** - Like Amazon/Netflix recommendations
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Real-time emotional state detection
- **Market Basket Analysis** - "Frequently bought together" patterns
- **User Segmentation** - Clustering users into behavioral groups
- **Time Series Forecasting** - Demand prediction
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Deep learning on user patterns

## Current Capabilities (Even Without API Keys)

The system still provides enterprise-grade features:
1. **Real-time behavior tracking** - Every mouse movement, click, hover
2. **Statistical predictions** - Advanced scoring algorithms
3. **User segmentation** - Rule-based classification
4. **Session analysis** - Conversion probability calculations
5. **Product ranking** - Optimized based on user behavior
6. **Performance monitoring** - Full metrics dashboard

## API Endpoints Ready for AI

When you configure API keys, these endpoints will automatically start using AI:
- `/api/ai/behavior-analysis` - User behavior pattern analysis
- `/api/ai/recommendations` - Collaborative filtering recommendations
- `/api/ai/sentiment-analysis` - Emotional state detection
- `/api/ai/user-segmentation` - AI clustering of users
- `/api/ai/demand-forecasting` - Time series predictions

## Verification

To verify if AI is working after adding keys:
1. Add API keys to `.env.local`
2. Restart the server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the browser console
4. Interact with products (hover, click)
5. Look for: `üß† [AI Engine] Enterprise AI prediction`

If you see `‚ö†Ô∏è [AI Engine] No AI capabilities configured`, the keys aren't properly configured.

## Cost Considerations

- **Groq**: Free tier available, very fast inference
- **OpenAI**: Pay per token, GPT-4o-mini is cost-effective
- **Anthropic**: Pay per token, Haiku model is cheapest

The system is designed to be cost-efficient:
- Caches AI predictions for 5 minutes
- Batches similar requests
- Falls back to statistics if API fails
- Only calls AI when user shows real intent

## Summary

**Current**: Statistical predictions (no API costs, still powerful)
**With AI Keys**: Enterprise-grade AI like Amazon/Netflix

The entire infrastructure is built and waiting - just add an API key to activate!
